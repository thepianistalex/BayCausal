\usage{
post_process_L(
  res,
  order_flag,
  pos_sign,
  cutoff = -Inf,
  remove_singleton = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A list containing MCMC samples}

\item{order_flag}{A logical indicating whether to order the columns of L}

\item{pos_sign}{A logical indicating whether to enforce positive sign on the first non-zero element of each column of L}

\item{cutoff}{A numeric value indicating the threshold below which the elements of L are set to zero}

\item{remove_singleton}{A logical indicating whether to remove columns with only one non-zero entry (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
post processed samples
}
\description{
Post processes the MCMC samples of L by ordering the columns, enforcing positive sign on the first non-zero element of each column, and setting elements below a threshold to zero. Optionally, it can also remove columns that have only one non-zero entry after thresholding.
